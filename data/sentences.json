  "a01-003": "Though they may gather some Left-wing support, a large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution. Mr. Foot\u2019s line will be that as Labour M Ps opposed the Government Bill which brought life peers into existence, they should not now put forward nominees. He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear to \u2019prop up\u201d an out-dated institution.",

Sir Roy is violently opposed to Africans getting an elected majority in Northern Rhodesia, but the Colonial Secretary,",
  "a01-014": "Sir Roy\u2019s United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on the Protectorate\u2019s future. Said Mr. Nkumbula last night: \u201dWe want to discuss what to do if the British Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall through. There are bound to be demonstrations.\u201d Yesterday Sir Roy\u2019s chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield, telephoned his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at Chequers.",

These plans do not give the Africans the overall majority they are seeking. African delegates are studying them today. The conference will meet to discuss the function of a proposed House of Chiefs.",
  "a01-026": "MR. IAIN MACLEOD, the Colonial Secretary, denied in the Commons last night that there have been secret negotiations on Northern Rhodesia\u2019s future. The Northern Rhodesia conference in London has been boycotted by the two main settlers\u2019 parties - the United Federal Party and the Dominion Party. But representatives of Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation, went to Chequers at the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan.",
  "a01-030": "Northern Rhodesia is a member of the Federation. Mr. Macleod was not at the week-end meeting. But he told M Ps yesterday: \u201dI have no knowledge of secret negotiations.\u201d He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal Government. But the final decision remained with the British Government. Mr. James Callaghan, Labour\u2019s Colonial spokesman, said Sir Roy had no right to delay progress in the talks by refusing to sit round the conference table.",
  "a01-043": "Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume today. PRESIDENT KENNEDY today defended the appointment of a Negro as his Housing Minister. It has aroused strong opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the Deep South. The negro is Mr. Robert Weaver of New York. One of his tasks will be to see there is no racial discrimination in Government and State housing projects.",
  "a01-049": "Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana, sparked off the opposition by telling a television audience it was *current Washington gossip\u201d that Weaver once had Communist affilia- tions. The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by another Southern Senator - Willis Robertson, of Virginia - met today in closed session to discuss Weaver\u2019s ap- pointment. Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several complaints about Weaver\u2019s loyalty.",
  "a01-053": "He said these concerned Mr. Weaver\u2019s alleged association with organisations black- listed by the Government.

He did not mention personal talks with Dr. Adenauer, the West German Chancellor.",
  "a01-063": "But he said discussions \u201don a higher level than in the past\u201d might be useful. The President will probably discuss the problem with Dr. Brentano, the West German Foreign Minister, who is due in Washington next week. A big slice of Germany\u2019s *aid\u201d is the early payment of a 210million debt to America. United States officials quickly point out that this is money due to America anyway.",
  "a01-068": "And they are unimpressed by the Germans\u2019 claim that they cannot pay more than 357million without upsetting their own economy. The Americans say Germany is having it too good and is not paying for the past or for the present. The Adenauer Government flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower Government to get them to pay a regular sum towards the cost of keeping American troops in Germany.",

He claimed slackness in the Eisenhower Administration had caused America to lag behind Russia in nuclear development. President Kennedy did his best to avoid giving Pressmen a direct answer. George Brown*; CHILDREN\u201d*; TWO men who are poles apart in personality last night dominated Parliament\u2019s fiercest battle since the 1959 election - Mr. George Brown and Mr. Enoch Pow- ell, the Health Minister.",
  "a01-087": "Mr. Brown, passionate and warm-hearted, led Labour\u2019s attack on the higher health charges. Mr. Powell, white-faced and outwardly unemotional, replied with a statis- tical statement - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps to angry uproar. One dealt with the human issue behind the Health Service; the other tried to show that the balance-sheet must always come first.",
  "a01-091": "The result of the vote was not in doubt. For the Tories were massed in answer to their whips to defeat a censure motion on the Government for \u201dundermining the Health Service\u201d and placing heavy burdens on those least able to bear them. Mr. Brown declared that the policy under censure was monstrous. It had offended many people far beyond the ranks of Labour supporters.",
  "a01-096": "The Press, many doctors and public were denouncing the proposals. He quoted from this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received: \u201dMy background is a doctor of 68, who has practised medicine for 43 years, chiefly as a panel doctor. \u201dI am a lifelong Conservative. I am horrified and amazed by my party\u2019s proposal to prostitute the whole principle of the State service and to render that service a hardship to poor people.",
  "a01-102": "\u201d After a lifetime of helping others and healing the sick, my considered opinion is that anybody supporting the increased charges is a wicked, old -.\u201d Mr. Brown went on: \u201d We are dealing with a noble edifice which needs an imaginative architect to improve it, but it has got a quantity surveyor. We have descended from the real problems to fiddling about with bills of cost.",
  "a01-107": "\u201d We believe that a comprehensive medical service, free to the patient at the point of need and with one standard for all sick people, is good and attainable. \u201dWe remain for it. But the Tories never were.\u201d Interrupted by angry Tories, Mr. Brown retorted: \u201dThe jackals bay when there is nothing better they can do.\u201d",
  "a01-113": "He told them that their conception of social services was wholly different - funda- mentally different from that of Labour. They would provide an ambulance service for the absolutely wretched - but it would not be too comfortable nor too easy to get. Answering jeers that it was Labour which first put a ceiling on health spending and started charges, Mr. Brown reminded the hostile Government benches that was done in 1950 because of the financial strain of the Korean war.",
  "a01-117": "a a In fact, the Tories made it worse now for the sick and needy than Labour had to make it in 1950. And as a percentage of social service expenditure, health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the unsmiling Mr. Powell. He demanded that instead of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless action against the drug making industry, whose profits had risen by up to 400 per cent. in the last eight years.",
  "a01-122": "\"Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out of mothers, children and sick people than to take on this vast industry,\u201d Mr. Brown commented icily. \u201dLet us have a full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d The health of children today owed much to the welfare food scheme. It was maintained during the war. Now in conditions of Tory affluence it seemed it could not be carried on.",
  "a01-128": "When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents on defence joined in. Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving details of plans for improving the hospital service, on which indeed the Government is making progress. His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that \u201deven after the proposed changes the net cost of the service to the Exchequer will have increased over three years by 20 per cent.",
  "a01-132": "\u201dThat cannot continue without either development being limited or an adjustment being made in financing.\u201d The Government decided to adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell claimed was underpinning - not undermining - the service. Answering the attack on \u201deconomic charges\u201d for welfare foods, Mr. Powell said that all these foods would still be free in families receiving regular National Assistance grants.",
  "a03-050": "On the other hand, Mr. Pearson excels in meeting people informally, but many still regard him \u201das some sort of cross between an egghead and a missionary\u201d. His party advisers are now trying to correct that image. The bow tie has gone; he is having lessons on television techniques and is being coached by speech experts.",
  "a03-071": "But, at the same time, there is reason to believe that the Federal Government is not convinced, on the basis of the information it has so far, that such a project would be justified from a scientific point of view; and not merely constitute a \u201d prestige\u201d satellite, duplicating to some extent American efforts, as Die Welt suggests today in a highly critical editorial article.",

  "a03-080": "The Foreign Ministry spokesman added today, however, that the Brussels Treaty was irrelevant, because research on the various rocket stages had already been concluded, and only cooperation on the type of capsule was involved. A lesser obstacle to German participation is the absence of any Ministry or Minister directly responsible for it - and therefore of any budget under which funds could be appropriated.",

  "a05-013": "The scheme will be subject to Cabinet approval. Mr. Watkinson remains convinced that the policy initiated in 1957, in Mr. Sandys\u2019s time as Minister of Defence, is still correct. This was to return to the tradition of all-Regular voluntary forces, with the last National Serviceman out of uniform by the end of 1962.",
  "a05-017": "The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as encouraging. He is confident the aim can be achieved. While the possibility of an eventual return to National Service in some form cannot be entirely discounted, he does not agree that the point has been reached where this need even be considered. If National Service is ever resorted to, engagement would probably have to be for three years.",
  "a05-022": "It is thought this would be the minimum necessary for the extended training modern arms require and to enable each man to serve at least a year overseas. There is no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson is at odds with the Service chiefs over the decision to dispense with National Service, or over any other aspect of defence policy.",
  "a05-025": "Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from retired officers who have held high positions but are out of touch with the existing situation. Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support from the C.I.G.S., Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, who believes completely in the principle of an all-Regular army. Gen. Sir Richard Hull, who is to succeed Sir Francis, is equally convinced Mr. Watkinson is",
  "a05-029": "Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard as from Nov. 1. The hand-over, due in September, was delayed because of the Berlin crisis. Mr. Watkinson and his advisers felt the change would be unwise at a moment when attention had to be concentrated on possible need for important military operations. For this reason Sir Francis stayed on, and sacrificed his leave. ,",
  "a05-039": "There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd, the Prime Minister. This implies the disappearance of the Progressive party from the House. Early results in yesterday\u2019s general election showed Nationalists being returned in their strongholds, like Bloemfontein and the Transvaal, with slightly increased majorities. In the Cape, the veteran United Party politician, Mr. Harry Lawrence, standing as a Progressive, was defeated in his constituency, Salt River, by the United party candidate, Mr. H. M. Timoney.",
  "a05-044": "The defeat of the leader of the Progressive party, Dr. Steytler, in Port Elizabeth South, announced immediately afterwards by the United party candidate, Mr. Plewman, left the Progressives deprived of both their chief figures. Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of the Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, have been returned unopposed. The contests were for 86 seats as 70 Nationalists and 20 United party candidates are unopposed.",
  "a05-048": "Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was evident that voters were bored by the Government\u2019s frequent appeals to the electorate. The election was the fourth in four years. In most constituencies it may go down as the most apathetic in the country\u2019s history. THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that he had con- sidered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to mobilise reserves necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing.",
  "a05-053": "He decided that it would be a great error to do so and to recall Parliament. But there would be no hesitation in mobilising if a further deterioration in the situation warranted such a step. It would have to be accompanied by other measures of a military, economic and political kind. Mr. Macmillan, who was winding up the foreign affairs debate, said the Government could not be party to accepting as a matter of principle the imposed division of Germany.",
  "a05-058": "\u201dWe must not be rattled into surrender, but we must not - and I am not - be afraid of negotiation.\u201d Mr. Godber, Minister of State, Foreign Office, said earlier that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests. The Council\u2019s findings would be made public.",
  "a05-062": "With a vigour and authority which delighted old Parliamentary friends and foes alike, the Earl of Avon, the former Sir Anthony Eden, in his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night, gave a warning that appeasement over Berlin could only lead to war. To stand firm, he declared, was not to invite war, but the surest way to avert it.",
  "a05-069": "It was the end of a rather curious speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up the two-day debate on foreign affairs. He began in a low, almost chatty monotone, and his voice never rose to any accent of urgency. He passed in rapid review the United Nations Secretariat; nuclear tests; the canard about British interference with the United Nations in the Congo; Kuwait; and South-East Asia.",
  "a05-073": "He spent most of his short half-hour on Berlin. He deplored the possibility of some new myth\u201d about betrayal of Germany by the Allies. \u2019We do not,\u201d he said, \u2019 really know what the Russians want.\u201d But he was certain that they wanted to establish a final and irrevocable division of Germany. Britain could not be a party to an imposed division. But negotiation, as the debate had shown, could be undertaken on a variety of bases.",
  "a05-080": "Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliberately refrained during the summer from recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation by proclamation, such as would be nec- essary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a fully active footing. That would have created a thoroughly undesirable atmosphere of panic. He thought that the situation was rather more hopeful.",
  "a05-084": "The Russians now realised its seriousness. The French doubts were more about pro- cedure than about substance. The Prime Minister\u2019s attitude of studied calm brought down the temperature of the debate, which never at any time rose to fever pitch, to a remarkable degree of sub-normality. Throughout Mr. Macmillan\u2019s speech the Earl of Home, Foreign Secretary, was listening in the Peers\u2019 Gallery.",
  "a05-089": "The early speakers in the debate each severely rated the speech of his predecessor. These strictures were all too well justified. We started with the plaintive wailings of Mr. Healey, \u201dShadow\u201d Foreign Secretary, described by Mr. Godber, Minister of State, Foreign Office, as \u2019* pedantic and obscure on Berlin, damaging and obscure on the Congo.\u201d In turn, Mr. Godber was censured by Mr. Shinwell, former Labour Defence Minister, for having read the House an ill-prepared essay.",
  "a05-094": "The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely. They remind one of the Rugby match in \u201dTom Brown\u2019s Schooldays,\u201d in which all the boys were welcome to take part, and only those who \u201dreally meant business\u201d removed their jackets. Not many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of to-night\u2019s debate. Mr. Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister\u2019s golf-course Press conference, which he described as \u201da display of flabby and fatuous complacency which takes us straight back to Neville Chamberlain.\u201d",
  "a05-099": "A reference to the reunification of Germany brought a bark of \u201dStart another war!\u201d from Mr. Ellis Smith (Lab., Stoke on Trent S.). Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet theme of limitation of armaments in Europe. This could, he suggested, be linked with prohibition of the production of atomic weapons in any part of Europe. Inspection and control would be much easier to establish in these territories.",
  "a05-104": "Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards. Ministers had rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the new Russian tests, but they themselves had no condemnation for events in Angola or Algeria. It was not for the Government, said Mr. Healey, to take up moral attitudes, \u201d especially when the temple of their religion is the bingo-parlour.\u201d",
  "a05-108": "This puzzled such students of comparative religion as had failed to detect this cult. But Mr. Healey had a partial and limited success. He rallied behind him the Left- wing opinion so coolly snubbed last night by his leader, Mr. Gaitskell. Mr. Godber\u2019s performance merited all the mild scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell.",
  "a05-113": "True, he did tell the House that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests, and said that the council\u2019s findings would be published. He was not so happy in his defence of the Government\u2019s failure to condemn France for her nuclear tests in the Sahara on the grounds that they were only little ones.",
  "a05-116": "This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid and her illegitimate baby. For the most part, Mr. Godber muttered his way through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office brief. He resembles the elephant seal, an otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is limited, we are told, to a series of heavy sighs. Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas, M.P. for Leicester N.E., a former Labour Solicitor-General, and Mrs. Barbara Castle, M.P. for Blackburn, a member of the Labour party National Executive, delivered a letter to Mr. Soldatov, the Russian Ambassador, last night protesting against the Russian nuclear tests.",
  "a05-121": "It was signed by 60 Labour M.P.s, many of them Left-wing sympathisers. It condemned *the pollution of the world\u2019s atmosphere as a crime against humanity.\u201d A personal letter of protest against the tests from Canon Collins, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, addressed to Mr. Khruschev, was also taken to the Russian Embassy.",
  "a05-125": "A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes: Ban-the-bomb demonstrators thronged",
  "a01-038": "Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties had refused to attend the talks because Sir Roy had found messages sent from the Government were \u201dunsatisfac- tory.\u201d African delegates to the talks yesterday called on Mr. Macmillan to cease his negotiations with Sir Roy\u2019s representative, Mr. Julius Greenfield. He was at Che- quers last week-end. They said they regarded with \u201dgrowing anger\u201d the \u201dgross and unconstitutional\u201d interference by Sir Roy\u2019s Federal Government in the talks.",
  "b01-057": "A CURIOUS advertisement appears on page nine, paid for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament. Those who lend their names to this kind of advertisement are worthy people, a little innocent of politics, perhaps, or carried away by the idea that moral regeneration would solve all our problems. So it would. While we are waiting for the millenium, however, most of us would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in instruments of democracy, such as trade unions and our local and national Parliaments.",
  "b01-062": "Should the Herald publish such advertisements? This is a difficult question. It would obviously be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with which we disagree. When an advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful, or where the total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers, it is right to exercise editorial discretion. The MRA advertisement falls into neither category, though many readers will dislike it.",
  "a02-000": "MR. MACMILLAN has picked a strong \u201dbrains trust\u201d team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market. And he has abandoned plans to visit President de Gaulle this month to smooth the way. General de Gaulle\u2019s official welcome last week to Britain\u2019s moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall, but no more than that.",
  "a02-004": "So the idea of a personal mission by the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped. Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon, Britain\u2019s Ambassador to France, to back Mr. Edward Heath, Lord Privy Seal, who is charged with the conduct of negotiations with the Six. At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests.",
  "a02-008": "Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys, Commonwealth Relations Secretary, that they wish to be kept in touch in London. Three of them - Canada, Australia, and New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening meeting in London on Monday. Once the Common Market\u2019s Council of Ministers draws up the procedure for negotiations in a fortnight\u2019s time, these Commonwealth countries can arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating team.",
  "a02-012": "The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several fields. Sir Pierson Dixon has a wide reputation as a skilful backstage negotiator since his days as Britain\u2019s chief UN delegate. Second in command is Mr. Eric Roll, 53-year-old Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fisheries. The Foreign Office is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay, who has taken part in all the detailed Common Market exchanges over the past year with the French, Germans, and Italians.",
  "a02-017": "Other leading members are: Sir Henry Lintott from the Commonwealth Relations Office, Sir William Corell-Barnes (Colonial Office), Mr. G. R. Bell (Treasury), and Mr. G. H. Andrew (Board of Trade). They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when he goes to Brussels, headquarters of the Common Market Commission, or wherever the Six decide negotiations should be held.",
  "a02-020": "Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville, French Foreign Minister, and Mr. Heath. MR.

They point out that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning the apartheid policy.",

The responsibility rightly belongs to the nations which have undertaken the task of pre- serving peace in the Congo. That is not a ceremonial duty, and the soldiers have every right to blame the politicians unless they see it through. When the United Nations instructed Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to prevent civil war, it was clear that new dangers would arise unless it gave him the physical power to. comply",

  "b01-122": "It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Verwoerd in his nightmare world. It is this that makes illusory any hopes that he may be influenced to change course. The Archbishop of Capetown, Dr. Joost de Blank, has pleaded that South Africa should be allowed to stay in the Commonwealth. Otherwise, he says, those inside the country who still oppose apartheid will be left even more isolated and alone.",
  "b01-127": "The views of the Archbishop, who has maintained an unflinching witness to what Christianity really means, must carry weight. But what, in fact, can the other Commonwealth countries do to bring support and comfort to this gallant minority? THERE is no evidence that the policy of appeasement has modified the actions of the Nationalists. On the contrary, apartheid is being applied ever more ruthlessly.",
  "b01-132": "The shock of expulsion from the Commonwealth now seems to be the only way left to try to bring home to the people of South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them to disaster. It may be that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers will decide against this final step. If that is their decision they should also go unequivocally on record that they regard apartheid as evil and indefensible.",

  "d04-131": "(3) I will redeem you. (4) I will take you to me for a people. (1) I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt: How was it that Israel was brought out from under the burdens of Egypt? Because, they kept the Passover and they were eating Matzos in Egypt and the \u201dFeast of Matzos\u201d was known even to Abraham and Lot.",
  "d05-008": "The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne. He was quite prepared to be tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot spoiled that. The Puritans had high hopes, for James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland, but those hopes were dashed. True, a new Prayer Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans derived little comfort from it.",
  "d05-021": "This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had been the mood which produced the Black Rubric, for it says that \u2019the Body and Blood of Christ, which are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u2019 It could hardly be more definite. It was at this time, too, that King James made himself immortal by becoming associated with a Bible translation - the Authorized Version (which was never actually authorized!).",
  "d05-025": "In that year Shakespeare had just turned forty and had written Hamlet two years before. Bacon was at work and Milton was just learning to read. James was followed by Charles, in whose reign came the Scottish Prayer Book in 1637. Significantly this made a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and became the foster mother of some of the most important Prayer Books in the Anglican Communion.",
  "d05-030": "Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud, now so much nobler a figure than former historians led us to believe. Laud was enthusiastically hated by Calvinists and Puritans, and the sentiment was mutual. But Laud was no Romanizer. One of his first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with the Jesuit, Fisher. But anyone who was friendly with James and Charles, the Puritans argued, was necessarily a menace.",
  "d05-013": "They objected to the word Absolution. So the phrase \u2019or the remission of sins\u2019 was added. But Absolution remained. They objected to the word Confirmation. So the phrase \u2019or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and able to render an account of their faith according to the Catechism following\u2019 were added. But Confirmation remained. Other changes in the Book were equally minor except for the new section on the Sacraments added to the Catechism.",
  "d05-040": "Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church? Laud made a positive approach. He set out to increase a sense of reverence. The Prayer Book was to be respected and so was the office of a bishop. Altars should be altars and not any broken down, transportable table which was handy for the most improbable uses.",
  "d06-000": "In the first place it is not a great deal of use telling even children, as I have already suggested, not to be silly or to pull themselves together. Far better to help them to face whatever it is that is worrying them, to find the original cause and then deal with it; show it up either for the sham it is - and many fears are based upon completely irrational pre-conceived notions - or to show how we may deal with it so as to remove the power to torment us that it seems to possess.",
  "d06-091": "There may be some who will argue that routine destroys the soul. It is so easy, they say, to get into a rut. Save us from the school curriculum and even worse the school system whereby for meals everybody knows beforehand exactly what, on any given day of the week, they are going to have. If - such a critic may say - you are calling us to adventure, do not strangle us before we start by putting us into a strait-jacket called \u2019order\u2019.",
  "e06-006": "The effect of bottom congestion due to the light pressure is inevitably mixed with that of the suitability of ground for spawning. Both result in crowding, so there is no need to try to separate them - thank Heaven! A good picture of this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning grounds from the Viking in the north down to the Klondykes and the Reef along the western edge of the Norwegian Deep.",
  "e06-037": "The East Anglian behaviour (see p. 82) has always differed from that of the summer fisheries. There is the \u201d*swim\u201d at slack waters, even in daylight sometimes; and the high swimming, when fish are caught only in the top few yards of netting. These and other fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery, which unfortunately seems to be dying out; but a full discussion of them is beyond the present scope.",

As adults, we know that their fears are groundless, indeed to us they appear laughable, but to a child they are very real. Not that I am suggesting that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made to face their fears, to see through them and come out on the other side as victors.",

  "e06-010": "In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom. Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure. But they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side, or westerly, until in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the echo- sounders. Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach their optimum depth; and this coincides with the suitable gravelly soil of these many roughs where the",
  "e06-046": "(Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved; it may be by actual contact, or by sight reaction to the disturbed sand; or even in the case of flat fish, by vibrations through or along the bottom.) But given such a bow wave of disturbance, it is obvious that without something to overcome its effect, very few fish would be caught.",
  "d06-011": "Because situations which may contain all the elements of fear can arise suddenly, it is a good idea to condition a child to some extent against it. To keep a child of twelve or thirteen under the impression that nothing nasty ever happens is not merely dishonest, it is unwise. As I shall suggest in a later chapter there are some situations which occur less frequently than they did once, or at least do not now arise until a later period of life, but this is no reason for leaving a child in complete ignorance to the extent of even lying to it when it asks questions.",
  "d06-107": "It was a little complicated to work, of course, and there had to be a big notice in the entrance saying which day of the timetable it was - but it added immensely to the interest and kept everybody on their toes. To have order does not mean getting into a dull routine. I have great sympathy with the young wife who does not always want to do the washing on a Monday.",
  "e06-003": "Thus we can see that herring movements, although primarily instinctive perhaps, and certainly helped and hindered by water flow, are also closely related to the sea-bed geography. Geography, too, names the great fisheries that depend on them: the Fladen Ground (where again most big shots are taken on the edges), the Gut, a deep- water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the northern edge; a good contour map will almost define the migrations of these summer herring.",
  "e06-015": "The joint evidence of echo-sounders and fishing gear leads to an overall though some- what dim picture. The details are harder still to see. Drift Effects. At East Anglia, for instance, shoals that gather at the Knoll or other banks are most of them going to travel a hundred miles farther south before they spawn. Some will spawn at the Hinder banks, which are half-way; and it may be that in their southerly march the herring will spawn wherever the suitable gravelly bottom soil coincides with their final ripeness.",
  "e06-030": "Easterly winds, on the other hand, mean no herring along the shore, as recent years have shown. A succession of winds is needed for this effect of course - one breeze will not do it, though a very hard westerly will often start off the local\u201d herring; but quite apart from this wind effect there is an easterly drift special to this rump of coastline, caused by the meeting of water from north and south.",
  "d06-025": "...Today A wonderful thought In the dawn was given... And the thought Was this: That a secret plan Is hid in my hand; That my hand is big Big, Because of the plan That God, Who dwells in my hand, Knows this secret plan, Of the things He will do for the world Using my hand.",
  "d06-067": "In other ways, too, life for the ordinary individual has become so complex that it taxes the mind. Two hundred years ago, men lived and worked in one place, their lives were of one piece. Now a man may live twenty, thirty even sixty miles from his work. The only connexion is the pipeline of the railway on which they travel day by day.",
  "d06-104": "They only worked, of course, a five-day week so that in the first week Monday to Friday were days one to five of the timetable, the following Monday was day six and Tuesday started day one again and so on. By this means they avoided each week being the same with a pupil knowing exactly what the subject would be on Friday afternoon at 3 p.m..",
  "e06-026": "Drift in another form probably explains how these migrating herring are biased to east or west by the different winds. Strong westerlies are well known to bring good longshore fishings. The surface water that is blown offshore must be replaced by an underflow bringing with it the herring to the Norfolk and Suffolk beaches.",
  "e06-049": "Let us consider first what would appear to be the simplest case - that of flat fish on the bottom. The evidence suggest that the fish are aware of the moving footrope before it reaches them. They move away before it, swimming at the same speed for an unknown period of time, until they become (1) tired, or (2) more used to the",

  "d06-056": "They drag themselves around and can become a burden to their families and their friends. Any mental confusion can cause this and the best way is probably to seek advice. As we are unable to cure our own bodies if the cause of our pain is too deep seated, so we are unable to cure our own minds, if the trouble is a complicated one involving careful and patient treatment.",

  "e06-000": "This could hardly happen without the herring having some orientation with the sea",
  "e06-021": "So the arrival of any particular shoal fish at a certain spawning ground may be ac- cidental. Yet there will always be some that find it if enough are travelling, just as the robin who gets back exactly may be only one among thousands who do not. But this southerly migration is not accidental. Being contranatant or against the drift, it probably has a survival value in ensuring that the fry after hatching are drifted back",
  "d06-037": "To others, the long hours of the night bring only a disturbed tossing and turning which causes them to wake feeling worse than when they went to bed. We may begin to understand this a little better when we realize that tiredness itself is largely in the mind. Very few people, under normal conditions, work themselves to a standstill.",
  "d06-072": "In many cases, their homes know little of their place of work and their associates at the office or works wonder what they are possibly like in the surroundings of their homes. It is easy, desperately easy, to lead a \u2019double\u2019 life without ever deliberately planning to do so or in fact being conscious of what is going on. It is easier to live life in compartments but over the years it builds up, and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which need to be handled correctly.",
  "d06-100": "As it is, with so much of our life already in a predetermined groove, I would hardly like to add further to the dullness which it engenders. But I am not arguing for this. I know how much of a drag it can be and I was interested some little while ago to hear of a school who tried a six-day timetable.",
  "e06-033": "Herring fishermen call this \u2019the outset\u201d. It is strongest at spring tides, when without wind you will \u201d \u2014 r drift to the eastward, the inngth of hall \u00ab Gus et of net - almost a mile on every ti ide at the Smith\u2019s Knoll. Without an explanation of how it works, it may corey be that this outset, akin to the mouth of a great salmon river, has been the biggest factor through the ages in the constancy of this great herring fishery.",
  "e06-070": "Actually the seine net has little or no cover. And in this film the rise of the fish was small, a matter of a foot or two. With round fish like haddock, which would hardly find safety on the bottom, this cover would seem to be even more essential; but more films are needed to prove this. Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered essential to catch round fish whose reaction to disturbance would be upwards.",
  "d06-041": "The mind tires first and conveys the impression of tiredness to the body. This can be proved by noting the effect of a new stimulus on somebody who feels thoroughly tired. Suppose a mother has news late at night that her child is in danger. She will undertake a journey which, an hour before, she would have declared impossible.",
  "d06-060": "One of the greatest steps forward that has been made this century is the way in which illness of the mind is no longer feared or shunned, and is in fact no differently regarded than physical illness. There is, nevertheless, a great deal of tiredness which comes from no major complication but results from an inability to deal with life, especially under the diverse pattern which is the twentieth century.",
  "d06-086": "The housewife would find life far less tiring if she made a list, followed a routine of work rather than getting from one thing to the next. The business man would find that he reached the end of the day with far less strain if he was a little more systematic. To drift aimlessly along is more wearying than anything else. If we would only sit down and write out all the necessary jobs waiting to be done and then work quietly through them, we would find life considerably less exhausting - and in the end we would do more.",
  "d06-113": "She will, in fact, be surprised at what peace of mind ensues. (b) Concentrate on one thing at a time. A list or a plan enables us to put all our energies into the particular matter on hand.",
  "e06-053": "Then they stop swimming and are caught. In the seine-net film this usually seemed to happen just after the fish had risen above the footrope, and presumably out of its field of disturbance, or bow wave. This suggests that the wave might be transmitted by the sea-bed, though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom and was indeed passing over some fish.",

(This can be supported by the use of the expression: *Boaz did it of his own accord but there was no approval of his action in Heaven\u2019 in both sugyoth.

  "e07-072": "DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes since the end of the war, clay pots are still in greatest demand. It is mostly in the smaller sizes that the substitutes have made headway, and although numerous small clay pots are used each year, they are fewer than they were 10 years ago. In the larger sizes there is still no real substitute for clay that can be obtained at a comparable price, except the bituminized paper pots which are used on commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes and chrysanthemums.",
  "e07-076": "The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its brittle nature; even with reasonably careful handling, the annual losses are often around 10 per cent., and where the handling and storage facilities are not too good, these losses will be even greater. This does not necessarily apply to the larger sizes, as they are not quite so fragile as the smaller ones and are not normally thrown about in quite the same way.",
  "e07-079": "The storage problem puts clay pots at a definite disadvantage. They are fairly heavy and difficult things to accommodate and they must have some protection from severe weather, which can be quite a headache in a small garden. While admitting that broken pots have on occasions provided artists with delightful studies, there is no doubt that a pile of badly stacked, half-broken pots is an unlovely sight from any point of view.",
  "e07-083": "Every garden boy will agree that having to wash clay pots is a definite factor in favour of their abolition; in fact one young man was so wholehearted about this a few years ago that he made the headlines for having smashed a large number to relieve his feelings. On the small-to-medium establishment, it is a disagreeable chore which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm, whereas on larger establishments the pots can be sterilized or washed by machine.",
  "e07-086": "It is not easy to make an economic comparison between clay pots and the various substitutes; the former may last indefinitely with luck, while the latter are often expendable used only once. Clay pots are efficient and congenial containers in which to grow plants. In their proper setting they are not unattractive and, in spite of their shortcomings, most gardeners have a nostalgic affection for them.",
  "e07-090": "Present-day pots are better finished, do not get dirty so readily and are easier to wash. The deep rims make for neater and safer stacking, though they are still expensive and still get broken. On the other hand, there is really no replacement for the larger sizes, so they have the decided advantage of being the only suitable container available in quantity for fairly large plants.",
  "e07-094": "Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay pots for plant raising. These are compressed blocks of compost, made in a specially devised press to simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot. Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape, they are made of the same compost as would have been used in a pot, the only difference being that it is used in a slightly moister condition.",
  "e07-098": "Seed is sown, or seedlings are pricked out into them in the normal way, the only real difference being that more of the watering is done through a rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout of water. First-class plants of tomatoes, cucumbers, marrows, melons, cauliflowers, celery and onions, may all be raised in soil blocks; so can such flowering plants as dahlias, chrysanthemums, salvias, sweet peas, lupins and numerous others.",
  "e07-101": "One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious one: the cost of a pot of any description is saved completely. Manufacturing the block and planting it is very little more trouble than normal potting, and a superior plant, which transplants more easily, is produced. The obvious limitation is that soil blocks can only be used for propagating; there can be no progression to a larger block when the plant or seedling is ready to be moved; it must be planted out or potted.",
  "e07-105": "Many amateur gardeners might improve their results by buying a small hand-operated soil block maker and use the money saved on buying small pots to improve their com- posts. The various types of small paper pots are very useful for short-term operations, but are inclined to collapse if the plants are in them too long.",
  "e07-108": "They are quite useful for plants that are despatched to market or direct to customers, their cheapness making them attractive to the nurseryman; there is also considerable saving in carriage costs because of their lightness. There are many types of plastic pots available; some expensive, some quite cheap; some good and others not so good.",

Though Lady Byron knew perfectly well that Byron, as early as the year of their wedding, 1815, had made a will in Augusta\u2019s favour, she had evidently not passed on that information; and it came as an appalling surprise to Captain Byron that he had been left without the fortune that would keep up the title.",
  "f07-002": "It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum. Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at the progress of civilisation which allows a dish borrowed straight from the prehistoric. How many centuries ago, in some cave or hilly hide, did our forebears home from the chase hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of meat or fish burnt and roasted in the homely and protecting flame.",
  "f07-006": "How many centuries later did the mercenary in the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his evening meal. Later came the thrifty peasant, later still the young Victorian buck adventuring in Paris, and even later our attractive young ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants.",
  "f07-009": "And, if certain dishes and modes of food have persisted down the ages, the motive that preserved them has always been the same. Apart from the need for nourishment, the instinct of hospitality has always been strong in mankind. The sharing of a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an admittance into an acquaintanceship far more important than the casual meetings of the present day; the desire to share something more intimate than mere converse has always been there.",
  "f07-013": "The truth is that good food offers a programme of entertainment almost unlimited in its variety and its presentation affords an opportunity of showing a guest something of ourselves. It is a far enough cry from the primitive meal-times of a simpler world to the banquets of later days, when the table groaned under its load of complicated dishes, and for all the blossoming of the arts around them the diners were little removed: it was still fingers before forks - from their prototype, the hungry hunter.",
  "f07-016": "There was always the spice of an orgy in those Roman feasts, for instance, with all their peacocks and nightingales\u2019 tongues; unreasonable surfeit, too, in the elaborate fashion of eating brought out of Italy into France, we are told, by Catherine de Medici. The peasant in those days, as ever, ate sparingly, but generously enough in his own fashion, save at feast times, when he, too, let himself go; and it was from his simpler food that the later renaissance of cooking was to come.",
  "f07-019": "Epicures and gourmands, sated by the unending procession of dishes from those mam- moth kitchens of the 18th century - that amazing epoch of grossness and delicacy - sought inspiration at last from the dishes of the country, and, instead of gorging the eye with magnitude, began to understand the value of intelligent selection and comparative simplicity, though nowadays their simplified meals would seem quite monstrous.",
  "f07-021": "Does one, however, know who first thought of boiling water and food? The ancient Britons, I believe, used to make water hot by dropping a red-hot poker into it, because their pots would not stand fire; but Jacob must have had one that would, because Esau sold his birthright to him for a mess of pottage - and then we hear of the fleshpots of Egypt after which the Israelites sighed.",
  "f07-024": "Anyhow, Homer does not seem to have known any way of cooking meat except by roasting and boiling. When Achilles gave a royal feast the principal dish was a grill, which he cooked himself, and he knew how to do it, too: - When the languid flames at length subside, He throws a bed of glowing embers wide; Above the coals the smoking fragment turns, And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns.",
  "f07-028": "When, however, the Greeks did learn the art of making fireproof earthenware from the Egyptians, their cookery made rapid progress, because they were men of taste and intellect. A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets of the ancient world was the fact that they did not confine the resources of the table to the gratification of one sense alone. Having exhausted their invention in the preparation of stimulants for the palate, they broke fresh ground and called another sense to their aid.",
  "f07-032": "By delicate application of odours and richly-distilled perfumes, these refined voluptuar- ies aroused the fainting appetite and added a more exquisite and ethereal enjoyment to the grosser pleasures of the board. The gratification of the sense of smelling was a subject of no little importance to the Romans. They considered flowers as forming a very essential article in their festal preparations; and it is the opinion of Bassius that at their desserts the number of flowers far exceeded the number of fruits.",
  "f07-036": "When Nero supped in his Golden House, a mingled shower of flowers and odorous essences fell upon him; and one of the recreations of Heliogabalus was to smother his courtiers with flowers. Nor was it entirely as an object of luxury that the ancients made use of flowers; they were considered to possess sanative and medicinal qualities.",
  "f07-069": "Foodlore reflects much more of national temperament than is customarily imagined as well as entering human activities to a greater extent than is usually assumed. We naturally cannot overlook that Magyar cookery owes one of its most classic features to the Turkish rule under which the Hungarians groaned for nearly 200 years. If that country had not been for so long a battlefield red with the blood shed to defend Christian civilisation, Hungary would have been deprived of the condiment which provides many Magyar dishes with a vivid and brilliant scarlet hue.",
  "f07-073": "The Austrian cuisine embraces the delectable 6Wiener Schnitzel as well as dishes and stews heightened with aromatics where the paprika insinuates its perfidious fire, aerian creams, ingenious pastries and a crescent-shaped breakfast roll created by a pastry cook to celebrate the victory against the Turks in 1683. Spanish cookery is reminiscent of bull-fights, of Spanish dancing and of Goja: it is vivid, highly coloured, sometimes Quixotic and withal it has a sombre ardour, with streaks of poetry, meat disguised under heavy and vehement sauces, pimentos and rancid butter.",
  "f07-081": "The French have an inborn appreciation of good food and the gusto which they derive from gastronomy is intellectual and aesthetic as well as physical. There is the same finesse about their feeding, the same subtle delicacy of touch, the same unfailing sense of proportion as exists among her writers, music composers and other exponents of things that are typically French.",
  "f07-084": "The \u201dpot-au-feu\u201d is as much a national institution in France as is tea drinking among ourselves and it is prepared at least once a week in every bourgeois household. Thack- eray, of course, waxed enthusiastic about Bouillabaisse and sang - This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is, A sort of soup, or broth, or brew, A hotch-potch of all sorts of fishes That Greenwich never could outdo; Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron, Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace.",
  "f07-076": "The Czechoslovak kitchen, again, is so languorous, so passionate, and possibly com- parable alone to a gypsy melody. The paprika and caraway perfume the meats with their antithesis. The opulent varieties of Czechoslovak pastries recall in fact the rich heritage of rich embroideries and costumes specifically national. The art and science of cookery, however, is essentially French, and, irrespective of the fact that I have never run across anyone in Gaul who has been a glutton, I can positively say that it has been equally difficult to find one who has not been an epicure.",
  "f07-088": "A fascinating study also opens up in the dietary welcomed by men of genius as well as the foods for which they have had an aversion. Shelley, for example, had a great con- tempt for animal food, believing that it impaired the intellectual faculties. Bunyan\u2019s breakfast and supper consisted of a piece of coarse bread and a bowl of milk.",
  "f07-092": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food. At one dinner he is said to have been blind to the charms of turbot and to have been much more interested in the dish in which it was served. He turned it over on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back without going through the formality of having his turbot removed first.",
  "f07-096": "Wagner was a highly practical feeder. He ate very fast, placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as he talked. Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe which he washed down with beer. A writer who had dinner with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters, a brown sole, a baked leg of mutton with oyster veal stuffing and a gin punch.",
  "f07-101": "The same man went to see Carlyle, and, after mentioning that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh; but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to ask if his guest would have a cup of tea!",
  "g07-000": "When he saw Trelawny\u2019s printed letter, Lord Sidney wrote to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect throughout. He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his body to return to England than that course was \u2019immediately carried into effect\u2019 - not in spite of himself and Sir Frederick Stoven, but with their perfect concurrence, while General Adam was at Corfu the whole time and never interfered in the slightest degree about the matter\u2019.",
  "g07-003": "His only reference to Trelawny by name in the course of several communications to Hobhouse and Kinnaird about Byron\u2019s affairs is satirical: \u2019\"I have not the lLhonor of any acquaintance with Mr Trelawny who seems to have had charge of the Mule when Count Gamba accompanied the remains of our deceased friend to Zante....\u2019 If Trelawny failed even to meet Lord Sidney and the British Government\u2019s other representatives in the islands, while they warmly welcomed Gamba to their counsels, it would go far to explain his attempts to exalt himself at the young Italian\u2019s expense.",

  "g01-008": "Obedient to the policy of his King, de Vienne avoided trouble at sea as cleverly as Du Guesclin avoided it on land. Gaunt was compelled to give up his search for an elusive foe, and, afraid to return home without something to show, he foolishly attempted to besiege the well-protected fortress of St Malo. This involved the dreary method of mining operations in which Gaunt, under the Black Prince, had shown considerable skill at the siege of Limoges.",
  "g01-012": "When all seemed to be going well, a sortie surprised the Earl of Arundel, who at that moment had charge of the mine; the mine collapsed, and with it Gaunt\u2019s hopes of fame and glory. Gaunt was compelled to return to England a disappointed and now even despised failure. The \u2019ribald\u2019 Londoners, who cursed Gaunt as the murderer of Hawley, were also expressing their disappointment at the non-arrival of booty, and",
  "g01-016": "These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide obvious morals for those who are judges long after the event. It seems obvious that, though the longbows of yeomen could pierce the plate and mail of French knights, a brilliant battle was no substi- tute for a sound policy, and that, if archers had no target, campaigns became mere marauding route marches.",
  "g01-019": "It seems obvious that if an expedition to Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais, then the primary essential to the success of the French war was a navy in unquestioned command of the Channel. It seems obvious that divided forces were dissipating the advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included Calais, Cherbourg, Brest, Bor- deaux and Bayonne, and that there was no hope of final victory without a large-scale and concentrated invasion.",
  "g01-022": "But none of these deductions were drawn at the time, because large-scale war required money, and the citizens who had the money were not yet sufficiently at one with nobles and King to think their money well spent in financing a ruling class which despised them. The Commons were glad enough to enjoy the fruits of victory, they were not so eager to advance the needs of dynastic or baronial wars or even to provide the means for economic war, largely because it was not yet established that those who supplied means should also have control of ends.",
  "g01-025": "In this cruel process which was hammering out nations on the anvils of war, there was a constant stirring of those in authority to find some simple way out of the complicated financial 6impasse which always resulted, and in the story of the experiments and expedients to which the Exchequer resorted is the story of the prelude to the Peasants\u2019",
  "g01-027": "In appreciating this story, modern conceptions of governmental duties must be set aside. A modern government needs taxation not merely for defence and offence but for a very wide range of social services. A mediaeval oligarchy needed taxation in order to supplement the private wealth of the monarchy (the royal income from the revenues of crown lands, the fees of feudalism and the fines of justice) and to provide enough cash to meet royal expenses, and especially the expenses of waging war.",
  "g01-031": "Social service as a function of government was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its substitute was the mutual self-help of communities, whether those communities were monasteries, manors, townships, or wards and guilds of a city. A mediaeval tax was therefore in essence a forced payment whose return was the uncertain bounty of booty and the vague advantages of military glory; it was therefore always granted grudgingly and coupled with the vain hope that, in the words of Parliament after Parliament, the King might \u2019live of his own resources and carry on his war\u2019.",
  "g01-034": "When \u2019his\u2019 war did not bring victory and booty, a new group of Lords might oust the unsuccessful leaders, and the Commons, who usually supplied the hard cash, might be bold enough to demand the production of accounts, and even at times the impeachment of the unsuccessful. But the Commons were not the people, and even a full Parliament was not yet a true mirror of the nation.",
  "g01-037": "The people - Langland\u2019s \u2019folk\u2019 and Gaunt\u2019s \u2019knaves\u2019 - were villeins still tied to the feudal obligations of work or villeins who had bought their release, free labourers who worked for the highest bidders, free yeomen who had prospered enough to become successful farmers, the artisans, craftsmen, journeymen and small tradesmen of the towns, and the retainers and men-at-arms in the pay of landed Lords.",
  "g01-039": "None of these classes, except the yeomen, paid or expected to pay direct taxes. Dur- ing the fourteenth century, the traditional methods of financing the Exchequer had become stabilized. When the King and his Council required additional funds, they were usually granted an export tax on the wool trade, collected by means of that \u2019sta- ple\u2019 system which ensured that prices, quality and tax could be efficiently supervised and controlled, together with a subsidy or tax on all movable property.",
  "g01-043": "There were two other sources of public revenue - first, the Church, which wisely followed the lead of the Commons and in its own Convocations granted equivalent contributions, and second, the foreign merchants, with whom the King\u2019s officials had formerly made private bargains at \u2019colloquies of merchants\u2019, and whose payments were now authorized by parliamentary sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in excess of the rate for native merchants.",
  "g01-045": "In addition to these revenues, the King had the financial benefits of his position at the head of the feudal system, as its chief landowner and the recipient of the fines of royal justice. It was, therefore, a complicated and not very satisfactory financial system in which the borders between private and public purse were as ill-defined as the borders between private and national war, and in which the comparatively simple obligations of the feudal pyramid were becoming hopelessly involved with the complex bonds of trade and industry.",
  "g01-067": "But this time there was a very interesting attempt to apply a sliding scale to the payments demanded. The definition of an adult was altered to read \u2019over sixteen\u2019, and, where the poorest were to pay a groat, the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks, and between these two extremes a graduated scale of payments was fixed for the different classes of laymen and clerics.",
  "g01-070": "Again the resentment was widespread and the results disappointing - a tax estimated to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000. In the following year, 1380, the last and most notorious third poll-tax was agreed by a Parliament which met at Northampton. There were dark reasons for a meeting so far away from the capital in a town with poor communications and not over supplied with hostelries and lodgings.",
  "g01-074": "London was again in turmoil; but this time over a question of trade rivalry. A rich merchant from Genoa had been murdered, and John de Kyrkby, a Londoner, was one of those charged with the crime. It is clear from the chronicles that this was a sordid quarrel between monopolists and interlopers. The city merchants were jealous of foreign merchants who could tempt court and baronage with rarer luxuries than those within the scope of English traders, and whose prices could not be controlled",
  "g01-083": "A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure to mediaeval eyes. It was deter- mined that 100,000 was a fairer target, and the Parliament agreed to find two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied the remainder. The method of assessment to which the Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax. The manifest injustice of this method had been to a certain degree corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax, but this lesson was ignored, and the injustice trebled in weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult had to pay three groats, but this time an adult was re-defined as anyone over fifteen.",
  "h01-004": "The questions about children were the same as in 1951, except that they extended to all women who were or had been married. It was not regarded as practicable within the limits of the census to include particulars about the date of birth of each child, as had been done in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission.",
  "g01-088": "Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple arithmetic which argued that, as the first poll-tax had supplied 22,000, a tax of three times the rate would produce 66,000. The only concession made in view of the objections to the first two poll-taxes was the suggestion that the rich should help the poor - but this was only a pious hope because no machinery was provided for carrying it into effect, and a subordinate clause went far to nullify what small effects it had - no man and wife together were to pay more than twenty shillings, a restriction which applied to the generous rich as well as to the mean.",

  "g02-062": "At one and the same time, therefore, occur the beat of the apex, the thickening of the heart walls, and the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the contraction of the ventricles. Going on in Chapter Three to the movement of the arteries, likewise gauged from the dissections of living animals, Harvey noted that contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in systole, simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries and of the artery-like vein, and expulsion of the ventricular content.",
  "g02-065": "Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of ventricular contraction. During cutting or puncture of the ventricles, there is often forcible expulsion of blood from the wound. Arterial diastole is thus synchronous with cardiac systole but, when movement of blood through arteries is hindered by compression, infarction or interception, the more distal arteries pulsate less because their pulse is nothing other than the impulse of the blood entering them.",

About 32 per cent of all the workers employed in factories sponsored by the development corporations are em- ployed by the eleven largest firms and about 23 per cent by the next group of firms employing between five hundred and one thousand workers.",
  "h07-023": "In factories sponsored by the London new town development corporations the propor- tion of female employees, expressed as a percentage of all employees, varies from 23 per cent in Welwyn Garden City and 24 per cent in Hemel Hempstead to 35 per cent in Basildon and 55 per cent in Hatfield with an average of about 30 per cent - rather less than in the country as a whole.",

  "h07-030": "Some development corporations have sought to attract private investors by leasing part of the shopping area to companies experienced in commercial development who have undertaken the building and letting of the shops. But corporations have generally found it more satisfactory to build themselves, leasing the shops direct to traders, with breaks in the lease to enable rents to be increased in scale with the rising prosperity of the town.",

Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver was after this very bird and shot the farm-labourer in the face. All, however, ended well, reported the paper, since the pellets were easily removed and the labourer was able to return to work the same afternoon.",
  "r06-057": "We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta. You can free-wheel down a quarter of the way. In the middle of the journey is a valley with a sea of vines and olives and beaches of earth pricked to blood by the hoe. Rising from the flecked sea are islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and towns, grey, rose-headed mariners clinging like limpets to the rock.",
  "r06-062": "There is a curd of morning smoke and a muffled bell taps the sky. Here we stopped, as in fine weather we always stopped. Down below is the village of Cagnes, but between are pockets of heat and cold like the hands of friends or strangers, and a flurry of early smells, the dark bosoms of beech and the thin pine fingers kissed by the sun.",
  "r06-066": "Then here was Nice, and the old holiday sea, blue as a new school exercise book. The same old Nice, creamy, vulgar, out of time, bitter-sweet with the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant prostitutes, edging past grubby grandeur to the old sleeping port. This, and Paris, were my ruined pavilions, and I could catch the taste of dead dreams on my tongue like spray.",

  "r06-111": "Catherine lives in a white house overlooking the sweeping brown tides of the river.

In Catherine\u2019s left hand she carried the stories of Isaac Babel. After lunch we went to the pictures.
